    /**
        Configuration properties for a message channel.

        Channels let you specify different reliability and ordering guarantees for messages sent across a connection.

        They may be configured as one of two types: reliable-ordered or unreliable-unordered.

        Reliable ordered channels guarantee that messages (see Message) are received reliably and in the same order they were sent.
        This channel type is designed for control messages and RPCs sent between the client and server.

        Unreliable unordered channels are like UDP. There is no guarantee that messages will arrive, and messages may arrive out of order.
        This channel type is designed for data that is time critical and should not be resent if dropped, like snapshots of world state sent rapidly
        from server to client, or cosmetic events such as effects and sounds.

        Both channel types support blocks of data attached to messages (see BlockMessage), but their treatment of blocks is quite different.

        Reliable ordered channels are designed for blocks that must be received reliably and in-order with the rest of the messages sent over the channel.
        Examples of these sort of blocks include the initial state of a level, or server configuration data sent down to a client on connect. These blocks
        are sent by splitting them into fragments and resending each fragment until the other side has received the entire block. This allows for sending
        blocks of data larger that maximum packet size quickly and reliably even under packet loss.

        Unreliable-unordered channels send blocks as-is without splitting them up into fragments. The idea is that transport level packet fragmentation
        should be used on top of the generated packet to split it up into into smaller packets that can be sent across typical Internet MTU (<1500 bytes).
        Because of this, you need to make sure that the maximum block size for an unreliable-unordered channel fits within the maximum packet size.

        Channels are typically configured as part of a ConnectionConfig, which is included inside the ClientServerConfig that is passed into the Client and Server constructors.
