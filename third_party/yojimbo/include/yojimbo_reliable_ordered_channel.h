        Messages sent across this channel are guaranteed to arrive in the order they were sent.
        This channel type is best used for control messages and RPCs.
        Messages sent over this channel are included in connection packets until one of those packets is acked. Messages are acked individually and remain in the send queue until acked.
        Blocks attached to messages sent over this channel are split up into fragments. Each fragment of the block is included in a connection packet until one of those packets are acked. Eventually, all fragments are received on the other side, and block is reassembled and attached to the message.
        Only one message block may be in flight over the network at any time, so blocks stall out message delivery slightly. Therefore, only use blocks for large data that won't fit inside a single connection packet where you actually need the channel to split it up into fragments. If your block fits inside a packet, just serialize it inside your message serialize via serialize_bytes instead.
